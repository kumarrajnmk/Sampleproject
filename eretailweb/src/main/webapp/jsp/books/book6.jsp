						<li>In the early 1970s, Corey Sifter, the son of
							working-class parents, becomes a yard boy on the grand estate of
							the powerful Metarey family. Soon, through the family’s
							generosity, he is a student at a private boarding school and an
							aide to the great New York senator Henry Bonwiller, who is
							running for president. Before long, Corey finds himself involved
							with one of the Metarey daughters as well, and he begins to leave
							behind the world of his upbringing. As the Bonwiller campaign
							gains momentum, Corey finds himself caught up in a complex web of
							events in which loyalty, politics, sex, and gratitude conflict
							with morality, love, and the truth. Ethan Canin’s stunning novel
							is about America as it was and is, a remarkable exploration of
							how vanity, greatness, and tragedy combine to change history and
							fate.</li>
