						<li>If you went to school in the United States, you probably
							learned about the Civil War – but this book won’t be like what
							you learned in history class. Maybe your teacher took the
							controversial stand that the Civil War was all about states’
							rights… or maybe you learned all about the horrors slavery, but
							never quite figured out why things didn’t get better after the
							war ended. If you didn’t go to school in the United States,
							things are even more confusing. When the media is full of
							references to the Confederate flag, the legacy of slavery, and
							poverty in the American South, you might have a vague sense that
							things are bad because of the Civil War… but why? Why does a war
							that happened over a hundred and fifty years ago still cast a
							shadow over the United States? This book will tell you why. It
							will lead you, step-by-step, through the causes of the Civil War,
							and the effects. But unlike your high school history teacher, it
							won’t put you to sleep with long-winded biographies and lists of
							dates. The names you’ll learn are the big players, the ones with
							big personalities, who made big differences.</li>
