						<p>Viet Nam may be the only war we ever fought, or perhaps
							that was ever fought, in which the heroism of the American
							soldier was accompanied by humanitarianism unmatched in the
							annals of warfare. And the humanitarianism took place during the
							heat of the battle. The GI fixed as he fought, he cured and
							educated and built in the middle of the battle. He truly cared
							for, and about, those people. What other Army has ever done that?
							Humanitarianism was America's great victory in Viet Nam.
							Spearheading the humanitarian efforts were the air ambulance
							operations, call-sign Dust Off, the most dangerous of all
							aviation operations, which rescued some one million souls in Viet
							Nam. Dead Men Flying is the story of Charles Kelly, the father of
							Dust Off, who gave his life to save Dust Off - the greatest
							life-saver ever. His dying words - When I have your wounded - set
							the standard for combat medicine to this day. It is also the
							story of the author, Medal of Honor recipient General Patrick
							Brady, who learned from Charles Kelly and struggled to meet his
							standard. Brady led the 54th Medical Detachment as it rescued
							over 21,000 wounded - enemy and friendly - in 10 months, while
							sustaining 26 Purple Hearts. Finally, Dead Men Flying is the
							story of salvation in the midst of horror, courage in the face of
							adversity,	 and the miracle of faith in the heat of combat. A
							riveting tale from America's most decorated living soldier, this
							is a book that no American can afford to ignore..</p>
