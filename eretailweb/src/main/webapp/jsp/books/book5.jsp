						<p>Greatness comes in many forms, and as Garrison Keillor
							demonstrates daily on The Writer's Almanac, the most affecting
							poems in the canon are in plain English. Third in Keillor's
							series of anthologies, Good Poems, American Places brings
							together poems that celebrate the geography and culture that bind
							us together as a nation. Think of these poems as postcards from
							the road, by poets who've gotten carried away by a particular
							place-a town in Kansas, a kitchen window in Nantucket, a
							Manhattan street, a farm in western Minnesota. Featuring famous
							poets and brash unknowns alike, the verses in this exhilarating
							collection prove that the heart can be exalted anywhere in
							America.</p>
