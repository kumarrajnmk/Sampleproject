							Originally published in 1997 and now back in print, Making the
							American Self by Daniel Walker Howe, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
							author of What Hath God Wrought, charts the genesis and
							fascinating trajectory of a central idea in American history. One
							of the most precious liberties Americans have always cherished is
							the ability to "make something of themselves"--to choose not only
							an occupation but an identity. Examining works by Benjamin
							Franklin, Jonathan Edwards, Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass,
							Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, and
							others, Howe investigates how Americans in the 18th and 19th
							centuries engaged in the process of "self-construction,"
							"self-improvement," and the "pursuit of happiness." He explores
							as well how Americans understood individual identity in relation
							to the larger body politic, and argues that the conscious
							construction of the autonomous self was in fact essential to
							American democracy--that it both shaped and was in turn shaped by
							American democratic institutions. "The thinkers described in this
							book," Howe writes, "believed that, to the extent individuals
							exercised self-control, they were making free
							institutions--liberal, republican, and democratic--possible." And
							as the scope of American democracy widened so too did the
							practice of self-construction, moving beyond the preserve of
							elite white males to potentially all Americans. Howe concludes
							that the time has come to ground our democracy once again in
							habits of personal responsibility, civility, and self-discipline
							esteemed by some of America's most important thinkers. Erudite,
							beautifully written, and more pertinent than ever as we enter a
							new era of individual and governmental responsibility, Making the
							American Self illuminates an impulse at the very heart of the
							American experience. <br>
